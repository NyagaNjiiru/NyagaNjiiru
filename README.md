### Hello there :)
ðŸŽ® Iâ€™m a Game Developer & Full-Stack Developer on a quest to build immersive games and practical web solutions.
ðŸ”¨ Currently building:

- A CRM web app

- An E-Commerce platform

- A Booking management web app

- A 2D portfolio site (because why not make portfolios fun?)

ðŸŽ¨ Learning & leveling up in:

- Godot Engine (my current playground)

- GDScript & C# scripting for game dev

- Blender for 3D & voxel art

- UI/UX Design using Figma & Illustrator (game feel matters!)

ðŸŒ± Working towards creating my first 2D pixel RPG, and crafting a bunch of mini-games and side projects to sharpen my coding skills.

ðŸ§© Whether it's building a system, a scene, or a story â€” I love solving problems and making things that just feel good to use and play.

âœ¨ Letâ€™s connect!
If you love games, clean code, or just want to nerd out about pixel art â€” feel free to reach out!
(And maybe, one day, I'll beat you at chess too.)
